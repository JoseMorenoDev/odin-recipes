    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pasta salad recipe was given to me by a dear friend many years ago, and I've been making it ever since! It's great for barbecues.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Pasta: </strong> This colorful, top-rated pasta salad starts with one pound of tri-colored spiral pasta. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Dressing:</strong>  Use a bottle of store-bought Italian-style dressing or, if you want to go the extra mile, make your own at home. 
          
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seasoning mix:</strong>   Salad seasoning mix lends tons of savory flavor. 
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>Vegetables: </strong> You’ll need cherry tomatoes, three bell peppers (green, yellow, and red), and a can of black olives.
         </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes; rinse under cold water and drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk Italian dressing and salad spice mix together until smooth. Combine pasta, tomatoes, bell peppers, and olives in a salad bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Refrigerate salad, 8 hours to overnight.
        </li>
    </ol>
